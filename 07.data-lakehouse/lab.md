## Objectives:

- Learn how functions one perticular implementation of data lakehouse: Delta Lake.
- Observe the main components that separate data lake from data lakehouse:

    - logs
    - table statistics
    - time traveling

## Instructions:

1. Import the notebook in `lab_resources` to your Databricks workspace.
2. The notebook is done in the demo style. Run the cells and observe the results. Connect them with the concepts related to data lakehouse.
3. After you familiarized yourself with the basics, read about data layout optimization (OPTIMIZE, Z-ORDER). Test it in the notebook.
